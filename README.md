This algorithm was developed to determine the position of a vehicle on a particular lane from a video feed.

The code was developed using OpenCV written on Python3.6

As it was developed on a x64 environment; It may be necessary to modify some parts for code to run on x86 environment.

This algorithm is still under development.
